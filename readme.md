# Adversarial Search: Playing Connect 4

In this notebook, we implemented different versions of agents that play Connect 4:

> "Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs." (see [Connect Four on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four))

Note that [Connect-4 has been solved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#Mathematical_solution) in 1988. A connect-4 solver with a discussion of how to solve different parts of the problem can be found here: https://connect4.gamesolver.org/en/
